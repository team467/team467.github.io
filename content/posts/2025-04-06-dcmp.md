This past weekend, we competed on the Sosik field at the New England District Championship in Springfield, MA.

This was one of the hardest schedules 467 has seen in a long time, however the team rose to the challenge, pulling various upsets towards the end of qualifying matches. Despite exiting qualifiers in 30th place, our performance was strong enough that the captain of Alliance 8 (The Robocats: Team 1699) picked us as their first round pick. Rounding out our alliance was 58 the Riot Crew.

With our underdog alliance, we started the upper bracket with a major upset by beating Alliance 1 with a score of 225-153 in the first match. After a few more ups and downs, we were finally eliminated in Match 12, concluding our playoff run. However our performance was strong enough to ensure a place at the _FIRST_ World Championships in Houston, where you will see Team 467 and Nessie make their final dive!
