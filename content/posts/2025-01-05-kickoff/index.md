Reefscape is officially live! Our team got together for a watch party of the livestream, and safe to say we were impressed with the new style of gameplay. Excitement carried throughout the day as the team rushed to decrypt the game manual and start to formulate a game plan, even through our lunch break. Cannot wait to see what this season has in store for us, see you at week 1 Southern Maine district event!
