Last weekend, Team 467 participated in their first pre-season event, the NERD competition, held at Billerica Memorial High School. The day kicked off early at 8:20 AM, and we competed alongside several impressive teams including HYPER, TJ2, Redshift, and others.

We finished the qualification rounds ranked 12th overall, with a match record of 6 wins, 3 losses, and 0 ties. Despite some technical difficulties with our camera system—which is crucial for vision processing and coral placement—we adapted quickly. One of our drivers, the exposure of the camera was weird, other than that it was fine.

We were honored to be the first pick for Alliance 6 and won most of our matches. Although we were eliminated in Round 4 of the double elimination bracket, the event was a huge success. It was a fun, high-energy day filled with learning, teamwork, and excitement    .
