Last weekend, Team 467 jumped into our first pre-season event of the year, the NERD competition at Billerica Memorial High School! It was an exciting day filled with energy, creativity, and lots of great robots.
We finished the qualification rounds in 12th place with six wins and three losses. Even though we had a few challenges with our camera system (the exposure was acting a little off), our drivers handled it like pros and kept things running smoothly.
We were thrilled to be chosen as the first pick for Alliance 6, led by Team 4909, the Bionics. Together, we won most of our matches and had an amazing time competing side by side. Although our journey ended in Round 4 of the double elimination bracket, the event was a huge success filled with learning, teamwork, and excitement for whatâ€™s ahead this season.
