The Shrewsbury Colonials eat together as a team during the longer work days of the build season. Most weeks we have meals on **Friday Dinner, Saturday Lunch and Saturday Dinner**, however during vacation and at the end of the build season, meals on other days will also be added.

**Providing one team meal is a requisite for travel with the team.**

**Here are some helpful tips:**

**Lunches: Lunches will be setup starting at 11 am to serve at noon.**

Suggested items to serve:

Premade Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, Samosas, Pot Stickers, Dumplings, Loaded Potato Skins, Burritos, Quiche, Quesadillas, Stromboli, Calzone, Chicken or Veggie Nuggets, Chicken Tenders, Egg Rolls, Wraps with various fillings (meat and veggie), trays of Roasted Veggies

**Dinners: Dinners are setup starting at 5pm and served at 6:30 PM.** Meals consist of an entrée, vegetables or salad, rolls, drinks and a dessert.

Meals from the past have included pasta dishes, turkey or ham dinners, tacos, beef stew, chili, baked potatoes with toppings, etc. We always make sure a vegetarian option is available. **Ethnic dishes and vegetarian meals are always welcome and encouraged**

We will relay any information we receive about allergies and what is necessary to keep team members safe. You may be asked to make several portions of a meal without onions, or several portions without milk or cheese.

**Drinks**, Capri Sun is welcomed by the team and is easy to transport. Milk, juice, and soda are also welcome. The team serves coffee, tea, and cocoa for the team on most work days. Donations towards these items are always welcome.

**Not sure what to make?** Check out [www.food.com](http://www.food.com/) for easy recipes that the website will help you adjust for a crowd.

Plates, silverware, cups, and napkins are provided by the team. Please bring the serving utensils you need with you.

You, along with your child, will be assisted with setting up your meal. Meals may be heated through or kept warm in the ovens until ready to serve. We have 10 ovens, 10 microwaves, and 8 stove tops to help us get everything ready on time. Several team members will be assigned to clean up the room and assist you to your car.
