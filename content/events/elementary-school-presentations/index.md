Team 467 is committed to spreading STEM to the next generation of engineers. Every year, a group of students from Team 467 visits elementary schools in the [Shrewsbury Public Schools District](https://schools.shrewsburyma.gov/) to teach 4th graders about the engineering design process—and demonstrate our latest FIRST Robotics Competition robot. At their schools, students take part in curriculum related to engineering and design, and seeing our robot is a great way for them to experience it in real life.

Our presentations include an informational section on the engineering and design process, followed by a demonstration of our current robot and a quiz with prizes at the end! Overall, it's a great way to spread STEM awareness and build support for our team.
