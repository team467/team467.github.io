Team 467 is committed to spreading STEM to the next generation of engineers. Every year, a group of students from Team 467 visits elementary schools in the [Shrewsbury Public Schools District](https://schools.shrewsburyma.gov/) to teach 4th graders about the engineering design processâ€”and demonstrate our latest FIRST Robotics Competition robot. At their schools, students take part in curriculum related to engineering and design, and seeing our robot is a great way for them to experience it in real life.

Our presentations include an informational section on the engineering and design process, followed by a demonstration of our current robot and a quiz with prizes at the end! Overall, it's a great way to spread STEM awareness and build support for our team.
