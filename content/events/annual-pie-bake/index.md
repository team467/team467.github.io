title: Annual Apple Pie Bake
---

For over a decade, Team 467 has been building, baking, and selling fresh apple pies as one of the team’s primary student-run fundraisers. This year the students plan to bake around 750 pies to raise funds to help the team compete in the **_FIRST_ Robotics Competition** season for 2026.

In addition to being a fundraiser, Team 467 also reserves a generous set of pies each year to donate to local charities. Recent recipients have been Veterans, Inc., and The Worcester County Food Bank who greatly appreciate this addition to the Thanksgiving Menu.

Our crumble-top pies are baked under the watchful eyes of the Oak Middle School kitchen staff. The pies are all vegetarian and are absolutely delicious! We obtain 55 bushels of apples from [Flat Hill Orchards](https://www.flathillorchards.com) here in Massachusetts, that are peeled, sliced, and prepared, all in one day.

This year we will be baking pies on **November 22, 2025**.

**The price this year for a pie is $24**. Most pies are sold by pre-purchase from one of our students. In addition, on the same day, we will be selling pies at a table at the Winter Market in the Oak Middle School gym. We expect the pies at the Market to sell quickly!

The best way to pre-purchase our apple pies is to contact one of the student team members directly. Each student has pie tickets to sell.

Each ticket you buy allows you to pick up one fresh apple pie at **Oak Middle School on 11/22**. If you don’t know a student on the team, you can email us at [pies@shrewsburyrobotics.org](mailto:pies@shrewsburyrobotics.org), providing your contact information. One of the student team members will contact you to sell you a pie ticket.
