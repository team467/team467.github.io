### The Game

_Lunacy_ is a game played on a field known as the CRATER. Two ALLIANCES, one red and one blue, composed of three _FIRST_ Robotics Competition (FRC) teams each, compete in each MATCH. The object of the game is to attain a higher score than your opponent by placing the GAME PIECES in the TRAILERS hitched to the opposing ALLIANCE’S ROBOTS.
