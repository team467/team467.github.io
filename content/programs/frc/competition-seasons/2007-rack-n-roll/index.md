### The Game

Rack ’n' Roll is a game played on a field as illustrated in the figure below. Two ALLIANCES, one
red and one blue, composed of three teams each, compete in each match. The object of the game
is to attain a higher score than your opponent ALLIANCE by placing toroidal GAME PIECES on the
central goal structure (the RACK), and/or by having ROBOTS in their HOME ZONE and not in
contact with the playing field at the end of the match
