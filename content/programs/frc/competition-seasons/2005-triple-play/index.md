### The Game

Triple Play is played on a field initially set up as illustrated in the figures below. Two
alliances – one “red” and one “blue” – composed of three teams each compete in each match. The object of
the game is to attain a higher score than your opponent alliance by placing tetras on or into goals, getting three
goals in a row capped with tetras, and/or having all three robots on an alliance in their end zone at the end of
the match.
