## Shrewsbury Robotics Program

During the 2024 season we changed the structure of this program as follows:-

* **A new start date** which now aligns with the FIRST release date for the program in August.

* **Parents/guardians are expected to be the primary team coaches**. Student team members will be formed into teams which will primarily mentored and supervised by coaches comprised of their own guardians. This change allows Shrewsbury Robotics to help more teams and as such will make the program far more sustainable.

### Role of Team Coaches

Parents or Guardians volunteering to be the coach for their students team do not need any prior experience. The key requirement is a willingness to support the team and foster enthusiasm in the team members.

**Students are expected to learn and do the work themselves**. This is an important part of the program. When students discover information themselves they will remember it better and be more skilled at it next time. In many instances as Coach, you will be learning new skills alongside the students.

We need volunteers for each team as we can only support as many teams as we have coaches!

Each team must have 2 official _FIRST_ Lead Coaches. There are also plenty of other support activities for other guardians to do. When you sign up your student please make sure you indicate if you are willing to be a Lead Coach.

To ensure the safety of our students, all adults working with students in this program should meet the following requirements:
* Obtain a CORI check through Shrewsbury Public Schools.
* Be fingerprint checked through IdentoGo.
* Submit for a Youth Protection Policy check through _FIRST_.
* Minimum of 2 adults who have met these checks to be present every time the team meets.  These do not have to be the Lead Mentors.
